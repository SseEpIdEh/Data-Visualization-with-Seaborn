Data-Visualization-with-Seaborn

**Distribution Plots**
Let's discuss some plots that allow us to visualize the distribution of a data set. These plots are:

-distplot
-jointplot
-pairplot
-rugplot
-kdeplot
*******
***Categorical Data Plots**
Now let's discuss using seaborn to plot categorical data! There are a few main plot types for this:

-factorplot
-boxplot
-violinplot
-stripplot
-swarmplot
-barplot
-countplot
**************
**Matrix Plots**
Matrix plots allow you to plot data as color-encoded matrices and can also be used to indicate clusters within the data (later in the machine learning section we will learn how to formally cluster data).
**************

**Grids**
Grids are general types of plots that allow you to map plot types to rows and columns of a grid, this helps you create similar plots separated by features.
**************
**Regression Plots**

Seaborn has many built-in capabilities for regression plots, however we won't really discuss regression until the machine learning section of the course, so we will only cover the lmplot() function for now.

lmplot allows you to display linear models, but it also conveniently allows you to split up those plots based off of features, as well as coloring the hue based off of features.

**Style and Color**
We've shown a few times how to control figure aesthetics in seaborn.
