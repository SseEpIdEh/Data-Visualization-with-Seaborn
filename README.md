**Distribution Plots**
Let's discuss some plots that allow us to visualize the distribution of a data set. These plots are:

-distplot
-jointplot
-pairplot
-rugplot
-kdeplot
*******
***Categorical Data Plots**
Now let's discuss using seaborn to plot categorical data! There are a few main plot types for this:

-factorplot
-boxplot
-violinplot
-stripplot
-swarmplot
-barplot
-countplot
**************
**Matrix Plots**
Matrix plots allow you to plot data as color-encoded matrices and can also be used to indicate clusters within the data (later in the machine learning section we will learn how to formally cluster data).
**************

**Grids**
Grids are general types of plots that allow you to map plot types to rows and columns of a grid, this helps you create similar plots separated by features.
